            Hi! I'm Chandler. <br>I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable. I'm not great at the advice. Can I interest you
            in a sarcastic comment? <br> I'm hopeless, and awkward and desperate for love..

            Chandler Bing is a fictional character from the famous sitcom "F.R.I.E.N.D.S" which is played by Mathew
            Perry. This character is known for his charismatic personality. Apart from being stunningly handsome, he's
            hilarious and hella sarcastic. After his introduction, "Chandler" would be the new definition of sarcasm.
            Inspite of suffering from commitment issues, he gets married to one of the characters in the show, Monica,
            at the end of 7th season. <br><br>One of the best things I like about him as well as the show is the bonding
            that they share with each other. No matter how occupied you are, you always take time for your friends and
            help them out. This show has motivated me to speak in English in public. This guy is an incredible roommate,
            a loyal friend, a caring husband and a lovable father. He's everything one could ever ask for and anyone
            would marry him in a heartbeat. I'm so glad that I came across this show, otherwise I would've never known
            him at all.
